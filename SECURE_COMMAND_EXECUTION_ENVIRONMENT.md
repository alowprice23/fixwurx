# Secure Command Execution Environment (SCEE)

This document outlines the implementation of the Secure Command Execution Environment (SCEE) components from the LLM Shell Integration Plan v4.

## Overview

The Secure Command Execution Environment (SCEE) provides a sandboxed, permission-controlled system for executing commands and scripts generated by the agent system. It integrates security features like permission checks, resource limiting, credential management, and anti-stuck mechanisms to ensure safe and reliable command execution.

## Components Implemented

### 1. Command Executor (`command_executor.py`)

The core execution engine with the following features:

- **Command Validation**: Validates commands against blacklists and role-based permissions
- **Resource Limiting**: Enforces timeouts and resource constraints on command execution
- **Confirmation Flow**: Requires user confirmation for high-impact commands
- **Script Execution**: Supports both script files and inline script content
- **Anti-Stuck Integration**: Detects repetitive failures and triggers the blocker detection system

### 2. Permission System (`permission_system.py`)

Role-based access control system:

- **Role Definitions**: Predefined roles with associated permissions
- **Permission Checks**: Pattern-based permission matching
- **Role Assignment**: Associates agents with specific roles
- **Extensibility**: Support for custom roles and permission patterns

### 3. Credential Manager (`credential_manager.py`)

Secure credential storage and management:

- **Encrypted Storage**: Encrypts credentials at rest
- **Credential Substitution**: Resolves credential placeholders in commands
- **Access Control**: Permission-based access to credentials
- **Key Rotation**: Support for rotating the master encryption key

### 4. Blocker Detection (`blocker_detection.py`)

Anti-stuck framework for detecting and resolving command failures:

- **Failure Pattern Analysis**: Identifies recurring command failures
- **Solution Generation**: Generates solutions for known blockers
- **Solution Library**: Maintains a library of solutions for common issues
- **Integration with Planning Engine**: Uses the planning engine to generate solutions

## Implementation Details

### Command Executor

The command executor is the central component of the SCEE, responsible for securely executing commands and scripts:

```python
def execute(self, command_string: str, agent_id: str, 
            timeout: Optional[int] = None, 
            read_only: bool = False) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Execute a command or script securely.
    
    Args:
        command_string: Command or script to execute
        agent_id: ID of the agent requesting execution
        timeout: Optional timeout in seconds
        read_only: If True, only allow read-only commands
        
    Returns:
        Dictionary with execution results
    """
```

The execution process follows these steps:

1. **Command Validation**: Check the command against blacklists and verify it meets read-only constraints if applicable
2. **Permission Check**: Verify that the agent has permission to execute the command
3. **Confirmation Check**: Determine if the command requires user confirmation
4. **Credential Processing**: Replace credential placeholders with actual values
5. **Resource-Limited Execution**: Execute the command with timeout and resource constraints
6. **Anti-Stuck Detection**: Monitor for repeated failures and trigger blocker detection if needed

### Permission System

The permission system provides role-based access control:

```python
def check_permission(self, agent_id: str, command: str, target: str = "") -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Check if an agent has permission to execute a command on a target.
    """
```

Key features:

- **Pattern-Based Matching**: Supports wildcards and namespace patterns (e.g., "analyze:*")
- **Role Hierarchy**: Default roles include admin, agent, auditor, and readonly
- **Custom Roles**: Support for creating and modifying roles
- **Persistence**: Roles and assignments can be saved to disk for persistence

### Credential Manager

The credential manager securely stores and retrieves credentials:

```python
def get_credential(self, credential_name: str, agent_id: Optional[str] = None) -> Optional[str]:
    """
    Get a credential by name.
    """

def set_credential(self, credential_name: str, credential_value: str, 
                   agent_id: Optional[str] = None) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Set a credential.
    """
```

Security features:

- **Encryption**: Uses Fernet symmetric encryption to secure credentials at rest
- **Memory Safety**: Clears credential cache during shutdown
- **Access Control**: Integrates with the permission system for credential access control
- **Master Key Management**: Supports key derivation from passwords and key rotation

### Blocker Detection

The blocker detection system identifies and resolves command execution blockers:

```python
def detect_blocker(self, command_string: str, agent_id: str, 
                   failure_count: int) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Detect and analyze a potential blocker.
    """

def find_solution(self, blocker_id: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Find a solution for a blocker.
    """
```

Key features:

- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies similar commands to apply existing solutions
- **Solution Library**: Maintains a library of solutions for common issues
- **Automatic Resolution**: Can generate and apply solutions automatically
- **Feedback Loop**: Tracks solution success and failure rates

## Integration with Other Components

- **Planning Engine Integration**: The blocker detection system uses the planning engine to generate solutions for blockers
- **Agent System Integration**: The command executor integrates with the agent system through the agent IDs and roles
- **Shell Environment Integration**: Commands and scripts are executed in the shell environment
- **Anti-Stuck Framework Integration**: The command executor and blocker detection work together to prevent infinite loops

## Security Considerations

The SCEE implements multiple layers of security:

1. **Command Blacklisting**: Blocks known dangerous commands
2. **Permission System**: Enforces role-based access control
3. **Resource Limiting**: Prevents resource exhaustion
4. **Confirmation Flow**: Requires user confirmation for high-impact commands
5. **Credential Protection**: Securely stores and manages sensitive credentials
6. **Anti-Stuck Mechanisms**: Prevents infinite loops and repetitive failures

## Test Results

The tests (`test_command_executor.py`) verify the following functionality:

1. **Basic Command Execution**: Simple commands execute successfully
2. **Permission Checks**: Commands are only executed if the agent has permission
3. **Blacklist Enforcement**: Blacklisted commands are blocked
4. **Confirmation Flow**: High-impact commands require confirmation
5. **Credential Resolution**: Credential placeholders are correctly resolved
6. **Script Execution**: Both script files and inline scripts execute correctly
7. **Blocker Detection**: Repetitive failures trigger blocker detection

All tests pass, demonstrating the robust functionality of the SCEE implementation.

## Usage Examples

### Executing a Simple Command

```python
result = command_executor.execute("echo 'Hello, World!'", "meta_agent")
```

### Executing a Command with Credentials

```python
result = command_executor.execute("curl -H 'Authorization: Bearer $CREDENTIAL(api_token)' https://api.example.com", "planner_agent")
```

### Executing a Command in Read-Only Mode

```python
result = command_executor.execute("ls -la /path/to/directory", "auditor_agent", read_only=True)
```

### Handling Commands that Require Confirmation

```python
result = command_executor.execute("rm -r /path/to/directory", "meta_agent")
if result.get("confirmation_required", False):
    # Ask for user confirmation
    confirmed = get_user_confirmation(result.get("command"), result.get("reason"))
    if confirmed:
        result = command_executor.execute_with_confirmation(result.get("command"), "meta_agent", True)
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Resource Monitoring**: Enhanced resource usage monitoring and limits
2. **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging of all command executions
3. **Sandboxing**: OS-level sandboxing for even stronger isolation
4. **Credential Rotation**: Automatic rotation of credentials
5. **Distributed Execution**: Support for executing commands on remote systems

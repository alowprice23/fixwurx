# Auditor Error Format Standardization Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for the standardized error format as specified in `error_format_standardization.md`. The plan details what has been implemented and what is still needed.

## Completed Implementation

### 1. Extended Error Report Class

The `ErrorReport` class in `sensor_registry.py` has been extended to include all the specified fields from the standardized error format:

- **Core Fields (Already Implemented)**
  - `error_id`: Unique identifier with format ERR-YYYYMMDDHHMMSS-RANDOM
  - `timestamp`: ISO8601 formatted detection time
  - `sensor_id`: ID of the sensor that detected the error
  - `component_name`: Name of the component where the error occurred
  - `error_type`: Type of the error
  - `severity`: Severity level (CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW)
  - `details`: Detailed information about the error
  - `context`: Additional contextual information
  - `status`: Current status (OPEN, ACKNOWLEDGED, RESOLVED)
  - `resolution`: Description of how the error was resolved
  - `resolution_timestamp`: Time when the error was resolved

- **Extended Fields (Newly Implemented)**
  - `root_cause`: Root cause analysis result with detailed structure
  - `impact`: Impact assessment result with detailed structure
  - `related_errors`: IDs of related error reports
  - `recommendations`: Recommendations for resolving the error

### 2. Error Contextualization Integration

The `ErrorContextualizer` in `llm_sensor_integration.py` has been updated to:

- Generate explanations and recommendations using LLM
- Structure this information into the standardized format
- Update the ErrorReport object with extended fields
- Return a dictionary containing all enhanced information

### 3. Shell Interface Update

The `AuditorShell` in `auditor_shell_interface.py` has been updated to:

- Display the extended fields when showing error details
- Automatically enhance error reports with LLM-generated context when needed
- Provide a clean interface for viewing structured error information

### 4. Verification and Testing

A test script (`test_error_format.py`) has been created to verify:

- Creation of error reports with extended fields
- Proper serialization and deserialization of extended fields
- Integration with LLM for error contextualization

## Verification Results

The implementation has been tested and verified to:

- Correctly store and serialize extended fields
- Properly deserialize fields from YAML format
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing code

## Next Steps

For a complete implementation of the error format standardization, the following additional steps should be considered:

1. **Migrate Existing Reports**: Develop a script to migrate existing error reports to the new format.

2. **Update Visualization Tools**: Enhance any visualization or reporting tools to display the extended fields.

3. **Documentation Updates**: Update user documentation to explain the new extended fields and how to use them.

4. **Integration Testing**: Perform integration testing with the full auditor system to ensure all components work correctly with the new format.

# FixWurx "Auditor" Agent Specification
# THIS FILE CANNOT BE EDITED EXCEPT THE ITEMS HAVE BEEN COMPLETE OR PENDING#
## Overview

The Auditor agent serves as the mathematical brake that transforms FixWurx from an enthusiastic coder into a disciplined engineer. It provides a mathematically provable "✓ It's finished" mechanism so work stops exactly when all obligations are both present and correct—no sooner, no later.

## Primary Purpose

1. Certify completeness (every Δ-derived obligation exists)
2. Certify correctness (global energy at optimum & proofs ≥ 90% coverage)
3. Certify meta-awareness (all watch-dog invariants intact)
4. Emit the single authoritative Audit-Stamp that freezes the build or, if any invariant breaks, vetoes further merges with a minimal defect log

## Mathematical Foundations

### Δ-Closure ⇒ All Obligations Are Enumerated

```
Clos_Δ(Σ) = min⊇Σ {Γ∣Γ is closed under Δ}
```

**Lemma 14-Pieces**: If Δ is terminating and confluent, then the closure is unique.

### PL Inequality ⇒ Guaranteed Global Convergence

The Polyak–Łojasiewicz (PL) condition:

```
∥∇E(S)∥²₂ ≥ μ(E(S)−E*)(PL μ>0)
```

### Chernoff Risk Bound ⇒ Residual-Bug Probability

```
P_bug ≤ (1−f)ρ + f⋅2e^(−2nε²)
```

Where:
- f = fraction of obligations checked (≥0.9)
- n = fN samples
- ε = tolerated empirical failure rate
- ρ = historical base-rate (10⁻⁴)

### Lyapunov Martingale ⇒ "If Tests Stall, Block Merge"

```
E[Φ_{t+1}∣F_t] ≤ Φ_t−δ(δ>0)
```

## System Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Obligation Tracker**
   - Maintains the ObligationLedger
   - Computes Δ-Closure
   - Compares against RepoModules

2. **Correctness Verifier**
   - Calculates energy metrics (E, delta_E, lambda)
   - Computes proof metrics (f, n, rho, epsilon)
   - Ensures risk stays below SLA threshold

3. **Meta-Guard System**
   - Monitors semantic drift (Lipschitz bound ≤ 0.02)
   - Tracks reflection perturbation (ε′ ≤ ε/2)
   - Validates Lyapunov trend monotonicity

4. **Audit Stamper**
   - Generates authoritative Audit-Stamp
   - Formats comprehensive defect logs
   - Controls pipeline flow (pass/block)

5. **Data Storage Engine**
   - Persists all audit records
   - Maintains historical trends
   - Enables benchmarking and analytics

## Error Reporting System

The Auditor implements a comprehensive error reporting system that logs, categorizes, and tracks all issues:

### Error Categories

1. **Completeness Errors**
   - Missing obligations (ID-specific)
   - Redundant modules
   - Mapping failures

2. **Correctness Errors**
   - Energy not at minimum
   - Excessive residual risk
   - Proof coverage below threshold

3. **Meta-Awareness Errors**
   - Lipschitz drift violations
   - Reflection instability
   - Lyapunov stagnation

4. **System Errors**
   - Data store failures
   - Pipeline integration issues
   - Performance degradation

        return fail("ENERGY_NOT_MINIMUM", {"E": E, "ΔE": delta_E, "λ": lamb})

    f, n, rho, eps = proof_metrics()
    p_bug = (1 - f) * rho + f * 2 * math.exp(-2 * n * eps**2)
    if p_bug > 1.1e-4:
        record_error("RISK_EXCEEDS_SLA", {"P_bug": p_bug})

## Integration with FixWurx Pipeline

The Auditor integrates seamlessly with the existing FixWurx pipeline:

```
User Request → Δ-Closure → Code & Proof Synthesis → AUDITOR → Deploy/Return
```

If the Auditor issues a PASS stamp, the pipeline proceeds to deployment. If it issues a FAIL stamp, it returns a concise defect list to the orchestrator for remediation.

## Conclusion

The FixWurx Auditor Agent transforms the system into a disciplined engineering platform with mathematical guarantees of completeness, correctness, and stability. By implementing comprehensive error reporting, gap analysis, patch management, and benchmarking systems, it ensures that FixWurx can objectively determine when work is truly complete and meets all quality standards.

The Auditor's role as a mathematical brake—not a generator—ensures it serves as an objective guardian of quality without expanding scope or introducing complexity. Its data-driven approach provides not just a binary pass/fail verdict but also valuable insights into system health, improvement opportunities, and historical performance.

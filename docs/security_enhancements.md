# Security Enhancements in FixWurx

This document details the security enhancements implemented in the FixWurx system to improve overall system integrity and resilience.

## Patch Integrity Verification

### Overview

The patch integrity verification system ensures that patches cannot be tampered with between the time they are registered and when they are applied or rolled back. This security measure prevents unauthorized modifications to patches that could potentially introduce vulnerabilities or compromise system functionality.

### Implementation Details

The patch integrity verification system works by:

1. **Calculating a cryptographic hash** of each patch's content at registration time
2. **Storing the hash** alongside the patch in the registry
3. **Verifying the hash** before applying or rolling back the patch
4. **Detecting tampering** by comparing the stored hash with a newly calculated hash of the current patch content

The system uses SHA-256, a secure cryptographic hash algorithm, which ensures:
- Even a small change to the patch will result in a completely different hash
- It is computationally infeasible to generate a modified patch that has the same hash as the original

### Technical Components

The following components were implemented to support patch integrity verification:

1. **Hash Calculation Function**:
   ```python
   def _calculate_patch_hash(content: str) -> str:
       """Calculate a secure hash for patch content."""
       return hashlib.sha256(content.encode('utf-8')).hexdigest()
   ```

2. **Hash Verification Function**:
   ```python
   def _verify_patch_hash(patch_path: Path, expected_hash: str) -> bool:
       """Verify that a patch file matches its expected hash."""
       if not patch_path.exists():
           return False
       content = patch_path.read_text(encoding='utf-8')
       actual_hash = _calculate_patch_hash(content)
       return actual_hash == expected_hash
   ```

3. **Enhanced Patch Registration**:
   The `register_patch` function was enhanced to:
   - Calculate a hash of the patch content
   - Store both the patch file and its hash in the registry

4. **Enhanced Patch Rollback**:
   The `rollback_patch` function was enhanced to:
   - Retrieve the expected hash from the registry
   - Verify the patch's current hash against the expected hash
   - Raise a security error if verification fails
   - Proceed with rollback only if verification succeeds

### Benefits

The patch integrity verification system provides several security benefits:

1. **Tamper Detection**: Any unauthorized modifications to patches will be detected
2. **Increased Confidence**: Rollbacks can be performed with confidence that the correct patch is being applied
3. **Audit Trail**: The stored hash serves as part of an audit trail for security verification
4. **Future Extensions**: The foundation for more advanced security measures like digital signatures

### Testing

A comprehensive test suite (`test_patch_integrity.py`) was developed to verify:
- Hash calculation consistency
- Proper storage of hashes during patch registration
- Successful hash verification during rollback
- Tampering detection when patches are modified

The tests confirm that the patch integrity verification system works as expected and successfully detects tampering attempts.

## Access Control System

### Overview

The access control system provides role-based permissions for all CLI operations and file access. This implementation enhances security by ensuring that users only have access to the specific operations they need to perform their roles, following the principle of least privilege.

### Implementation Details

The access control system works by:

1. **User Authentication**: Users must authenticate to obtain a session token
2. **Role-Based Permissions**: Users are assigned roles that determine their permissions
3. **Operation Authorization**: Each operation is checked against the user's permissions
4. **Audit Logging**: All operations are logged for security auditing

The system uses secure hashing with salting for password storage, and session tokens for authentication state management. The session tokens expire automatically after a configurable period (default: 8 hours).

### Technical Components

1. **User Management**:
   ```python
   def create_user(username, password, role, full_name, email, created_by):
       """Create a new user with the specified role."""
   ```

2. **Role Management**:
   ```python
   def create_role(role_name, description, permissions, created_by):
       """Create a new role with specific permissions."""
   ```

3. **Permission Checking**:
   ```python
   def require_permission(token, permission):
       """Require a specific permission, raising an error if not present."""
   ```

4. **File Access Control**:
   ```python
   def read_file(token, path, binary):
       """Read a file with permission check."""
   ```

5. **Audit Logging**:
   ```python
   def log_action(username, action, target, details):
       """Log an action for audit purposes."""
   ```

### Access Levels

The system implements three primary access levels through default roles:

1. **Admin**: Full access to all system operations
2. **Operator**: Limited access to system operations (can view status, queue, dashboards, etc.)
3. **Viewer**: Read-only access to system status

Custom roles can be created with specific permissions as needed.

### File Permission Model

The file permission model follows the traditional read/write/delete pattern:

1. **Read**: Permission to view file contents and list directories
2. **Write**: Permission to create or modify files and directories
3. **Delete**: Permission to delete files and directories

### CLI Integration

The CLI tool `tri` has been enhanced to support authentication:

```
# Authentication
tri login                 # Log in to the system
tri logout                # Log out

# User management
tri users --list          # List all users
tri users --create USER   # Create a new user
tri users --update USER   # Update a user
tri users --delete USER   # Delete a user

# Role management
tri roles --list          # List all roles
tri roles --show ROLE     # Show role details
tri roles --create ROLE   # Create a new role
tri roles --update ROLE   # Update a role
tri roles --delete ROLE   # Delete a role

# Audit log
tri audit                 # View the audit log
```

### Testing

A comprehensive test suite (`test_access_control.py`) was developed to verify:
- User management operations
- Role management and permission checks
- File access controls with different permission levels
- Directory operations with permission checks

### Benefits

The access control system provides several security benefits:

1. **Defense in Depth**: Adds an additional security layer beyond file system permissions
2. **Granular Control**: Allows fine-grained control over who can perform what operations
3. **Audit Trail**: Creates a comprehensive log of all security-relevant operations
4. **Separation of Duties**: Enforces proper separation of privileges between different user roles

## Future Security Enhancements

Building on the current security enhancements, the following measures could be implemented in future updates:

1. **Digital Signatures**: Add support for digitally signing patches using asymmetric cryptography
2. **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Implement two-factor authentication for sensitive operations
3. **Secure Storage**: Enhance the security of credential and token storage
4. **Intrusion Detection**: Add monitoring for suspicious activities and automatic blocking
5. **Automated Security Scans**: Integrate automated security scanning of patches before registration

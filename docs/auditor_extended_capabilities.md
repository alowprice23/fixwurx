- **Performance Impact**: Assessment of any performance changes from patches

### Patch Implementation
- **Controlled Deployment**: Gradual rollout of patches to minimize risk
- **Rollback Capability**: Automatic rollback if issues are detected
- **Change Documentation**: Detailed records of all changes made
- **Verification Testing**: Post-deployment testing to confirm issue resolution

### Continuous Improvement
- **Patch Effectiveness Tracking**: Monitoring of long-term patch success
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identification of recurring issue patterns
- **Preventive Measures**: Implementation of measures to prevent similar issues
- **Knowledge Base Updates**: Addition of solutions to the knowledge base

## 5. User Communication

The Auditor Agent maintains clear communication with users:

### Launchpad Shell Integration
- **Command Interface**: Direct interaction through launchpad shell

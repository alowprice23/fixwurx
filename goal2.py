FixWurx Goal2 Module

This is a placeholder implementation of the goal2 obligation that was detected as missing
by the FixWurx Auditor Agent. This module was automatically generated to satisfy
the Î”-closure requirements.

In a real-world scenario, this would be implemented with actual functionality
rather than as a placeholder.

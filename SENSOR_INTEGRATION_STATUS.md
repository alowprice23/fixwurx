## Completed Components (Additional)

### Component Sensors
- ✅ Implemented `EnergyCalculatorSensor` for monitoring system energy efficiency
- ✅ Implemented `ProofMetricsSensor` for tracking formal verification metrics

### Database Sensors
- ✅ Implemented `TimeSeriesDatabaseSensor` for monitoring time series database health
- ✅ Implemented `DocumentStoreSensor` for monitoring document store integrity

### System Sensors
- ✅ Implemented `MemoryMonitorSensor` for tracking memory usage and detecting leaks
- ✅ Implemented `ThreadingSafetySensor` for detecting threading and concurrency issues
- ✅ Implemented `AuditorAgentActivitySensor` for monitoring agent behaviors and patterns

## Pending Work

### System Sensors
- ✅ All system sensors have been implemented

## Next Steps

1. **Component Sensors**: Complete remaining component sensors using the patterns established in `GraphDatabaseSensor` and `MetaAwarenessSensor`
2. **Database Sensors**: Complete remaining database sensors using the established framework
3. **System Sensors**: Implement system-level monitors for memory, threading and agent activity
4. **Integration Testing**: Perform comprehensive end-to-end testing with all sensors active
5. **Cleanup**: Remove any obsolete or duplicate sensor implementations

## Technical Highlights

### Error Reporting
- Standardized error reporting format across all sensors
- Rich error context with root cause analysis capabilities
- Error lifecycle management (open → acknowledged → resolved)
- Session-based storage for persistent tracking

### Performance Benchmarking
- Complete implementation of all 20 KPIs for comprehensive monitoring
- Threshold-based detection for all metrics
- Lyapunov history integration for stability analysis
- Project-based organization for comparison across debugging sessions

### Sensor-LLM Bridge
- Natural language generation for error explanation
- System introspection capabilities
- Code-aware error analysis
- Health monitoring and reporting

### Storage System
- Hierarchical organization by project and session
- Chronological metrics snapshots
- Support for data export and analysis
- Cross-project comparison capabilities

### Testing Approach
- Mock components for controlled testing
- Comprehensive unit and integration testing
- Demonstration scripts for each major component
- Clear validation criteria for each component

## Open Questions

1. Should each sensor run in its own thread for better isolation?
2. How should we handle sensor failures (when the sensor itself has an error)?
3. What error aggregation and prioritization strategies should we implement?
4. How to scale the storage system for very large projects with thousands of sessions?
5. What visualization tools would be most effective for benchmark trend analysis?

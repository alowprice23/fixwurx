# System Architecture Implementation

This document outlines the implementation of the system architecture according to the blueprint diagram.

## Directory Structure Overview

The FixWurx system architecture follows a modular design with clear separation of concerns:

```

└── .github/workflows/    # CI/CD pipeline definitions
```

## Component Relationships

The architecture follows these relationships:

1. **Shell Environment (Launchpad)**: Central command interface
   - Interfaces with all components through command handlers
   - Provides script execution environment
   - Manages permissions and access control

2. **Agent System**: Distributed problem-solving network
   - Meta Agent: Coordinates other agents
   - Planner Agent: Creates solution paths
   - Observer Agent: Monitors the system
   - Analyst Agent: Analyzes code and generates patches
   - Verifier Agent: Validates solutions

3. **Triangulation Engine**: Bug-fixing workflow manager
   - Manages solution paths
   - Coordinates phase transitions
   - Tracks bug state
   - Integrates with neural matrix

4. **Neural Matrix**: Learning system
   - Pattern recognition
   - Weight-based optimization
   - Historical learning

## Architecture Verification

To verify the architecture matches the blueprint:

1. **Directory Structure**: 
   - All required directories are present and follow the blueprint
   - Files are organized according to their functionality

2. **Component Integration**:
   - Shell environment can access all components
   - Agents can communicate with each other
   - Triangulation engine can use the neural matrix
   - Monitoring systems can observe all components

3. **Functionality**:
   - Commands are properly routed to the correct handlers
   - Events are properly dispatched to listeners
   - Components can be extended through the module system

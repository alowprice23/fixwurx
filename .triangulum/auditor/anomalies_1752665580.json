    "description": "All agents have the same number of activities (34), which is unusual and may indicate a lack of diversity in task distribution or a potential issue with task allocation.",
    "recommendation": "Investigate the task allocation system to ensure tasks are being distributed according to each agent's role and capacity. Consider implementing a dynamic task allocation system to better balance the workload."

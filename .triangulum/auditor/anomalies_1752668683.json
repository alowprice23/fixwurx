    "severity": "high",
    "description": "The API latency and throughput values are significantly higher than CPU and memory usage, which suggests a potential bottleneck or inefficiency in the system.",
    "recommendation": "Conduct a detailed analysis of the API handling processes to identify and resolve any bottlenecks or inefficiencies that may be causing high latency and throughput issues."

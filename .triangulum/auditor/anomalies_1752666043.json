    "description": "All agents have identical activity counts of 22, which is unusual and may indicate a reporting or logging error.",
    "recommendation": "Verify the logging mechanism for agent activities to ensure accurate reporting. Investigate if there is a synchronization issue or a bug causing uniform activity counts."

    "type": "performance",
    "severity": "medium",
    "description": "The API latency is significantly higher than CPU and memory usage, which might indicate a bottleneck or network issue affecting response times.",
    "recommendation": "Conduct a detailed analysis of network performance and API handling to identify potential bottlenecks. Consider optimizing API endpoints or increasing resources to improve latency."

    "description": "Throughput is relatively high compared to CPU and memory usage, which might suggest efficient processing but could also indicate potential over-utilization risks.",
    "recommendation": "Monitor throughput trends over time to ensure that the system can handle the load without degrading performance. Consider scaling resources if throughput continues to increase."

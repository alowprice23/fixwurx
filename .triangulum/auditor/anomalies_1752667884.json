    "severity": "medium",
    "description": "All agents have identical activity levels, which is unusual and may indicate a lack of diversity in task distribution or a potential logging error.",
    "recommendation": "Investigate the task distribution logic to ensure that activities are being logged correctly and that tasks are being distributed according to the system's operational requirements."

    "type": "performance",
    "severity": "high",
    "description": "The API latency and throughput values are identical and unusually high compared to typical operational benchmarks, which could indicate a performance bottleneck or a data logging issue.",
    "recommendation": "Conduct a thorough analysis of the API and network performance to identify any bottlenecks or misconfigurations. Consider implementing monitoring tools to track these metrics more accurately."

    "type": "performance",
    "severity": "medium",
    "description": "The CPU and memory usage values are identical, which is statistically improbable and suggests a potential error in data collection or reporting.",
    "recommendation": "Verify the data collection process for CPU and memory usage to ensure accuracy. Check for any software bugs or misconfigurations in the monitoring tools."

    "type": "compliance",
    "severity": "low",
    "description": "Compliance status indicates both performance and reliability are true, despite the identified performance anomalies, which may suggest a discrepancy in compliance evaluation.",
    "recommendation": "Review the compliance evaluation criteria and process to ensure they accurately reflect the system's performance and reliability. Adjust thresholds or evaluation methods as necessary."

    "description": "All agents have identical activity counts of 39, which is unusual and may indicate a lack of diversity in task distribution or a potential logging error.",
    "recommendation": "Investigate the task distribution logic to ensure that tasks are being assigned appropriately to different agents. Check for any logging or data collection errors that might be causing uniform activity counts."

    "description": "All agents have the same activity level of 7, which is unusual and may indicate a lack of diversity in task distribution or a potential synchronization issue.",
    "recommendation": "Investigate the task allocation mechanism to ensure that tasks are being distributed according to the agents' capabilities and current workload. Consider implementing a dynamic task allocation system to balance the load."

    "type": "performance",
    "severity": "low",
    "description": "The CPU usage is relatively low at 34.04%, which might indicate underutilization of resources.",
    "recommendation": "Monitor the system over a longer period to determine if this is a consistent pattern. If underutilization persists, consider optimizing resource allocation or scaling down resources to reduce costs."

    "severity": "medium",
    "description": "The memory usage, API latency, and throughput are all at the same value of 54.04%, which is unusual and may suggest a data reporting or logging issue.",
    "recommendation": "Verify the data collection and logging mechanisms to ensure accurate reporting. Check for any bugs or misconfigurations in the monitoring tools."

    "severity": "low",
    "description": "Compliance status is marked as true for both performance and reliability, which is expected. However, without specific thresholds or benchmarks, it's difficult to assess the accuracy of this compliance status.",
    "recommendation": "Define clear compliance benchmarks and thresholds for performance and reliability. Regularly review and update these benchmarks to ensure they align with current operational goals and industry standards."

    "description": "All agents have the same activity count of 19. This uniformity might indicate a lack of diversity in task distribution or potential synchronization issues.",
    "recommendation": "Investigate the task allocation mechanism to ensure that tasks are being distributed according to each agent's specialization and capacity. Consider implementing a dynamic task allocation strategy."

    "description": "The API latency is significantly higher than other performance metrics, which could indicate a bottleneck or inefficiency in the system's communication processes.",
    "recommendation": "Analyze the API request and response times to identify any potential bottlenecks. Consider optimizing the API endpoints or scaling the infrastructure to handle the load more efficiently."

    "description": "The throughput value is notably higher than other performance metrics, which might suggest a potential mismatch in the system's capacity planning.",
    "recommendation": "Review the system's throughput capacity and ensure it aligns with the expected load. If necessary, adjust the system's resources to maintain balanced performance metrics."

    "severity": "low",
    "description": "Compliance status indicates performance and reliability are true, but without specific thresholds or benchmarks, it's unclear if these metrics are truly compliant with expected standards.",
    "recommendation": "Define clear compliance benchmarks for performance and reliability metrics. Regularly review these benchmarks to ensure they align with industry standards and system requirements."

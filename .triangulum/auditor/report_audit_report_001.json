    "cpu_usage": "The CPU usage is at 49%, which is within acceptable limits, indicating efficient processing.",
    "memory_usage": "Memory usage is at 69%, which is slightly higher but still within acceptable limits. Monitoring is advised to prevent potential issues.",
    "api_latency": "API latency is at 109ms, which is higher than optimal. This could affect system responsiveness and should be investigated.",
    "throughput": "Throughput is at 109, indicating a high level of data processing capability. This is a positive indicator of system performance."

  "key_findings": [
    "The system is compliant with all assessed standards: security, performance, and reliability.",
    "API latency is higher than optimal, which could impact user experience.",
    "A total of 26 anomalies were detected during the audit cycle, indicating potential areas for further investigation."
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "Investigate the cause of high API latency and implement measures to reduce it.",
    "Conduct a detailed analysis of the detected anomalies to identify any underlying issues.",
    "Continue monitoring memory usage to ensure it remains within acceptable limits and does not degrade performance."

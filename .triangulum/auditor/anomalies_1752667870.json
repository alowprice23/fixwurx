    "description": "All agents have the same number of activities (27), which is unusual and may indicate a lack of diversity in task distribution or a potential logging error.",
    "recommendation": "Investigate the task allocation mechanism to ensure that activities are being distributed appropriately among agents. Check for any logging or reporting errors that might be causing this uniformity."

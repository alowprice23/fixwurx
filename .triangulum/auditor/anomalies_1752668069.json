    "description": "All agents have the same activity count of 27, which is unusual and may indicate a synchronization issue or a logging error.",
    "recommendation": "Investigate the logging mechanism to ensure that agent activities are being recorded accurately. Check for any synchronization issues that might cause identical activity counts across different agents."

    "type": "performance",
    "severity": "high",
    "description": "API latency and throughput are both at 114.267 ms, which is unusually high and identical, suggesting a potential performance bottleneck or measurement error.",
    "recommendation": "Conduct a detailed performance analysis to identify any bottlenecks in the system. Verify the accuracy of the performance measurement tools and consider optimizing the API handling to reduce latency and improve throughput."

    "description": "Memory usage is at 64.267%, which is relatively high and could lead to performance degradation if it increases further.",
    "recommendation": "Monitor memory usage trends over time to ensure it remains within acceptable limits. Consider optimizing memory usage by reviewing and improving memory management practices in the system."

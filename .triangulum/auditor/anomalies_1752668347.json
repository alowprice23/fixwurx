    "description": "All agents have the same activity count of 27, which is unusual and may indicate a lack of diversity in task distribution or a potential logging error.",
    "recommendation": "Investigate the task allocation mechanism to ensure that activities are being distributed appropriately among agents. Check for potential logging issues that might be causing uniform activity counts."

    "description": "API latency is significantly higher than other performance metrics, which could indicate a bottleneck or inefficiency in the system's API handling.",
    "recommendation": "Conduct a detailed analysis of the API handling processes to identify potential bottlenecks or inefficiencies. Consider optimizing API calls or increasing resources allocated to API processing."

    "description": "CPU and memory usage are relatively low compared to throughput, which might suggest underutilization of resources or potential for optimization.",
    "recommendation": "Review resource allocation and system configuration to ensure optimal utilization of CPU and memory. Consider scaling down resources if they are consistently underutilized."

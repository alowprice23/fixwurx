    "description": "All agents have the same level of activity (23), which is unusual and may indicate a lack of diversity in task distribution or a potential issue with activity logging.",
    "recommendation": "Investigate the task allocation mechanism to ensure that activities are being distributed appropriately among agents. Check the logging system for potential errors or misconfigurations."

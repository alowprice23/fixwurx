  "executive_summary": "The audit of the system agents reveals a balanced distribution of activities across all agents, with satisfactory compliance with security, performance, and reliability standards. Performance metrics indicate efficient resource utilization, although there is room for improvement in API latency. The system is effectively monitored with a high number of compliance checks and a moderate number of anomalies detected.",

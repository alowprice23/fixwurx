    "description": "All agents have the same level of activity (6). This uniformity might indicate a lack of specialization or potential misconfiguration in task distribution.",
    "recommendation": "Review the task allocation logic to ensure that each agent is performing tasks according to its specialization. Consider implementing dynamic task distribution based on current system needs."

    "description": "API latency is significantly higher (69.70) compared to CPU and memory usage (both at 49.70). This discrepancy might indicate a bottleneck in network communication or inefficient API handling.",
    "recommendation": "Investigate the API handling processes to identify potential bottlenecks. Consider optimizing network configurations or reviewing API code for performance improvements."

    "description": "All agents have the same number of activities (29), which is unusual and may indicate a lack of diversity in task distribution or a logging error.",
    "recommendation": "Investigate the task allocation mechanism to ensure tasks are being distributed according to each agent's role and capabilities. Check for any logging issues that might be causing uniform activity counts."

    "security": "Compliant",
    "performance": "Compliant",
    "reliability": "Compliant"
  },
  "performance_analysis": {
    "cpu_usage": "The CPU usage is at a low level of 33.39%, indicating efficient processing.",
    "memory_usage": "Memory usage is moderate at 53.39%, suggesting adequate resource allocation.",
    "api_latency": "API latency is high at 93.39ms, which could impact user experience and needs optimization.",
    "throughput": "Throughput is at 143.39 transactions per second, which is satisfactory but could be improved for better performance."

  "key_findings": [
    "The system maintains compliance with all assessed standards: security, performance, and reliability.",
    "API latency is notably high, which could affect system responsiveness.",
    "The throughput is satisfactory but has room for improvement to enhance overall system efficiency.",
    "A total of 15 anomalies were detected during the audit cycles, which requires further investigation."
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "Investigate and address the causes of high API latency to improve system responsiveness.",
    "Explore opportunities to increase throughput for better performance.",
    "Conduct a detailed analysis of the detected anomalies to prevent potential issues.",
    "Continue monitoring agent activities to ensure balanced workload distribution and system efficiency."

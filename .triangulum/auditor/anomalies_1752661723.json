    "description": "All agent activities have the same count of 7, which is unusual and may indicate a lack of diversity in task execution or a potential logging issue.",
    "recommendation": "Investigate the logging mechanism to ensure it accurately reflects agent activities. Verify if the tasks are being distributed evenly or if there is an issue causing uniform activity counts."

    "type": "performance",
    "severity": "medium",
    "description": "The API latency is significantly higher than other performance metrics, which could indicate a bottleneck or inefficiency in the system's API handling.",
    "recommendation": "Conduct a detailed analysis of the API handling processes to identify and resolve any bottlenecks. Consider optimizing the API endpoints or increasing resources if necessary."

    "type": "performance",
    "severity": "low",
    "description": "The throughput value is notably higher compared to other performance metrics, which may suggest an imbalance in resource allocation or a potential misconfiguration.",
    "recommendation": "Review the system's resource allocation and configuration settings to ensure they are optimized for balanced performance across all metrics."

    "severity": "low",
    "description": "Compliance status indicates both performance and reliability are true, which is expected. However, given the anomalies in performance metrics, further investigation may be warranted to ensure compliance is accurately assessed.",
    "recommendation": "Re-evaluate the compliance assessment criteria to ensure they accurately reflect the system's performance and reliability. Consider implementing additional checks or thresholds for more granular compliance monitoring."

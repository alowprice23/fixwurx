    "description": "All agents have the same number of activities (21), which is unusual and may indicate a lack of diversity in task distribution or a reporting error.",
    "recommendation": "Investigate the task allocation mechanism to ensure tasks are being distributed according to each agent's role and capacity. Verify if the reporting system is functioning correctly."

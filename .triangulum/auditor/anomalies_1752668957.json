    "description": "All agents have identical activity counts (29), which is unusual and may indicate a lack of diversity in task distribution or a potential issue with activity logging.",
    "recommendation": "Investigate the task allocation mechanism to ensure that activities are being distributed appropriately among agents. Check the logging system for any errors or misconfigurations."

    "description": "API latency and throughput are both at 101.67, which is unusually high and may indicate a bottleneck or performance degradation in the system.",
    "recommendation": "Conduct a performance analysis to identify potential bottlenecks in the system. Consider optimizing the API endpoints and reviewing the system architecture for improvements."

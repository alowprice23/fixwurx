    "description": "All agent activities have the same count of 6, which is unusual and may indicate a lack of diversity in task distribution or a potential logging error.",
    "recommendation": "Investigate the task allocation mechanism to ensure that tasks are being distributed according to the system's operational needs. Check for any logging issues that might be causing inaccurate reporting of agent activities."

    "description": "The API latency and throughput are both at 104.03568720817566, which is significantly higher than typical values for these metrics. This could indicate a bottleneck or inefficiency in the system.",
    "recommendation": "Conduct a performance analysis to identify the root cause of the high API latency and throughput. Consider optimizing the API endpoints and reviewing the system architecture for potential improvements."

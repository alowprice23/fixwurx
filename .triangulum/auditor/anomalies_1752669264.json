    "description": "All agent activities are reported as 30, which is unusually uniform and may indicate a reporting error or lack of diversity in task allocation.",
    "recommendation": "Investigate the data collection process for agent activities to ensure accurate reporting. Consider implementing checks to ensure a more diverse distribution of tasks among agents."

    "type": "performance",
    "severity": "medium",
    "description": "The API latency and throughput are both reported as 107.91554737091064, which is unusually high compared to typical values. This could indicate a performance bottleneck or an error in measurement.",
    "recommendation": "Conduct a detailed performance analysis to identify potential bottlenecks affecting API latency and throughput. Verify the accuracy of the measurement tools and consider optimizing the system for better performance."

    "description": "The CPU and memory usage are reported as 47.915547370910645 and 57.915547370910645, respectively. While these values are within acceptable ranges, they are suspiciously similar, which may suggest a reporting issue.",
    "recommendation": "Review the data collection methods for CPU and memory usage to ensure they are being measured independently and accurately. Consider implementing additional monitoring to verify these metrics."

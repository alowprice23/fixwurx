    "description": "All agents have identical activity levels of 24, which is unusual and may indicate a lack of diversity in task distribution or a potential synchronization issue.",
    "recommendation": "Investigate the task allocation mechanism to ensure that activities are being distributed according to the agents' roles and capabilities. Consider implementing a dynamic task assignment system to balance the workload."

    "type": "performance",
    "severity": "high",
    "description": "The API latency and throughput are both at 101.29422736167908, which is unusually high and could indicate a bottleneck or performance degradation in the system.",
    "recommendation": "Conduct a thorough performance analysis to identify the root cause of high latency and throughput. Consider optimizing the API endpoints, reviewing the network infrastructure, and scaling resources if necessary."

    "type": "compliance",
    "severity": "low",
    "description": "Compliance status indicates both performance and reliability are true, which is expected. However, given the performance anomalies, this may need further verification.",
    "recommendation": "Re-evaluate the compliance checks to ensure they accurately reflect the current system performance and reliability. Implement additional monitoring tools to provide more granular insights into compliance metrics."

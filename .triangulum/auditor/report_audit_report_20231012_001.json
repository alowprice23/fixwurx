    "The number of reports generated (6) is relatively low compared to the number of compliance checks (93)."
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "Investigate and address the causes of higher API latency to improve response times.",
    "Enhance anomaly detection mechanisms to reduce the number of undetected issues.",
    "Increase the frequency of report generation to better document and track system performance and compliance."

    "description": "All agents have the same number of activities (13), which is unusual and may indicate a lack of diversity in task distribution or a reporting error.",
    "recommendation": "Investigate the task allocation mechanism to ensure that tasks are being distributed according to the agents' roles and capabilities. Verify the reporting system for any errors."

    "description": "The API latency and throughput values are significantly higher than CPU and memory usage, which could indicate a bottleneck or inefficiency in the system's handling of requests.",
    "recommendation": "Conduct a detailed analysis of the API handling processes to identify potential bottlenecks. Consider optimizing the code or infrastructure to improve latency and throughput."

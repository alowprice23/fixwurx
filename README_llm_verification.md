# LLM Agent Verification Tools

This package contains tools for verifying that all agents in the FixWurx system are properly connected to the OpenAI API, ensuring that we haven't deviated from the original purpose of the program.

## Overview

The FixWurx system is designed with LLM capabilities at its core. Every agent in the system should be connected to the LLM for intelligent decision-making and problem-solving. These tools help verify that this integration is working correctly.

## Files Included

- `llm_agent_verification_plan.md` - Comprehensive plan for verifying LLM integration
- `configure_openai_integration.py` - Script to configure the system to use the OpenAI API
- `verify_llm_integration.py` - Script to verify that all agents are properly connected to the LLM
- `verify_llm_agents.sh` - Shell script to run both configuration and verification (Unix/Linux/macOS)
- `verify_llm_agents.bat` - Batch script to run both configuration and verification (Windows)

## Usage

### Option 1: Use the Automated Scripts

#### On Windows:
Simply double-click `verify_llm_agents.bat` or run it from a Command Prompt:
```
verify_llm_agents.bat
```

#### On Unix/Linux/macOS:
Make the script executable and run it:
```bash
chmod +x verify_llm_agents.sh
./verify_llm_agents.sh
```

### Option 2: Run the Steps Manually

1. First, configure the system to use the OpenAI API:
   ```
   python configure_openai_integration.py
   ```

2. Then, verify that all agents are connected to the LLM:
   ```
   python verify_llm_integration.py
   ```

## Understanding the Results

After running the verification, you'll see a report showing which agents successfully called the OpenAI API and which did not. The results are also saved to `llm_verification_results.json` for further analysis.

### Example Output:

## Troubleshooting

If any agent fails the verification:

1. Check that the OpenAI API key is correctly set in all configuration files
2. Examine the agent's implementation to ensure it's using the LLM for its core functionality
3. Look at the log file `llm_verification.log` for detailed error messages
4. Check that the OpenAI Python package is installed correctly
5. Ensure the agent has the expected methods that should be using the LLM

## Custom API Key

If you want to use a different OpenAI API key, you can specify it when running the configuration script:

```
python configure_openai_integration.py --api-key="your-api-key-here"
```

## Agent Requirements

Each agent should be implementing LLM calls for their core functionality:

1. **Meta Agent**: Uses LLM for coordinating other agents
2. **Planner Agent**: Uses LLM for generating solution paths
3. **Observer Agent**: Uses LLM for analyzing bugs
4. **Analyst Agent**: Uses LLM for generating patches
5. **Verifier Agent**: Uses LLM for verifying patches
6. **Launchpad Agent**: Uses LLM for initializing and launching agents
7. **Auditor Agent**: Uses LLM for system audits and compliance checks

## Next Steps

After verifying all agents are properly connected to the LLM, you can:

1. Run the solution planning flow to see the LLM-powered agents in action
2. Test end-to-end bug resolution workflows
3. Ensure all other components of the system are working correctly

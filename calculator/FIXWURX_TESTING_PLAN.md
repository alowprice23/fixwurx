# FixWurx Testing Plan

This document outlines a comprehensive testing plan for validating FixWurx functionality using the intentionally buggy calculator application as a test case.

## 1. Testing Environment Setup

### Calculator Application Overview
The calculator application contains 34 intentional bugs across multiple components:
- Basic operations (4 bugs)
- Advanced operations (6 bugs)
- Validation utilities (6 bugs)
- Memory utilities (6 bugs)
- CLI interface (10 bugs)
- Main module (2 bugs)

### Required Tools
- FixWurx framework
- Python interpreter
- Test reporting system

## 2. Testing Process

### Phase 1: Individual Bug Testing

For each identified bug, we will:

1. **Feed the buggy module to FixWurx via CLI commands**
   ```
   fixwurx --analyze calculator/operations/basic_operations.py
   ```

2. **Document FixWurx interaction**
   - Record all prompts and guidance FixWurx requests
   - Document human responses provided
   - Capture all actions FixWurx takes

3. **Evaluate outcome** based on the six possible scenarios:
   - **Success with proper logging** - FixWurx correctly identifies and fixes the bug
   - **Failure without proper error information** - FixWurx fails silently or with minimal error data
   - **Crash with limited error information** - FixWurx crashes but provides some error context
   - **Failure with detailed error information** - FixWurx fails but provides actionable information
   - **False positive** - FixWurx reports success but bug remains
   - **False negative** - FixWurx reports failure but bug is actually fixed

4. **Run verification tests** to confirm if the bug was actually fixed
   ```
   python -m unittest calculator/tests/test_basic_operations.py
   ```

### Phase 2: Integration Testing

Test FixWurx against interdependent bugs that may require coordinated fixes:

1. **Feed multiple related modules to FixWurx**
   ```
   fixwurx --analyze calculator/operations/advanced_operations.py calculator/ui/cli.py
   ```

2. **Document resolution sequence**
   - Does FixWurx identify dependency issues?
   - Does it prioritize fixes in logical order?
   - Does it handle cascading effects of changes?

### Phase 3: Full Application Testing

Test FixWurx against the entire calculator application:

1. **Feed the entire project to FixWurx**
   ```
   fixwurx --analyze calculator/
   ```

2. **Evaluate the comprehensive analysis capability**
   - Does it create a proper bug dependency graph?
   - Does it prioritize critical fixes first?
   - Does it handle the interdependencies correctly?

## 3. Test Case Matrix

| ID | Bug Location | Bug Description | Expected FixWurx Behavior | Verification Method |
|----|-------------|----------------|---------------------------|---------------------|
| B1 | basic_operations.py | Incorrect order of operands in subtract | Identify and fix operand order | Run test_subtract test case |
| B2 | basic_operations.py | Using addition instead of multiplication | Identify and fix operation | Run test_multiply test case |
| B3 | basic_operations.py | No zero division check | Add validation for zero divisor | Run test_divide test case |
| B4 | basic_operations.py | Incorrect power implementation | Replace with correct exponentiation | Run test_power test case |
| A1 | advanced_operations.py | Missing random import | Add import statement | Run test_random_operation test case |
| A2 | advanced_operations.py | No negative number check in sqrt | Add validation for negative input | Run test_square_root test case |
| A3 | advanced_operations.py | Incorrect factorial base case | Fix return value for 0 | Run test_factorial test case |
| A4 | advanced_operations.py | Wrong logarithm function | Use correct math.log with base | Run test_logarithm test case |
| A5 | advanced_operations.py | Using cosine instead of sine | Replace with correct trigonometric function | Run test_sine test case |
| A6 | advanced_operations.py | Undefined random module | Fix import and implementation | Run test_random_operation test case |
| ... | [Additional bugs listed with similar format] | ... | ... | ... |

## 4. Data Collection and Analysis

For each test case, collect the following metrics:

1. **Time to detection** - How long FixWurx takes to identify the bug
2. **Fix accuracy** - Whether the fix correctly addresses the issue
3. **Human interaction required** - Number and nature of human interventions needed
4. **Error reporting quality** - Clarity and actionability of error messages
5. **Performance impact** - Any degradation in system performance during analysis

## 5. Reporting Framework

For each bug, generate a standardized report:

```
Bug ID: [ID]
Module: [File path]
Description: [Bug description]
FixWurx Analysis Duration: [Time]
Human Interactions: [Count and description]
Outcome: [Success/Failure category]
Verification Result: [Pass/Fail]
Error Information Quality: [High/Medium/Low]
Recommendations: [Improvements to FixWurx based on this case]
```

## 6. Iterative Improvement Process

1. **Analyze patterns in failure cases**
   - Common bug types FixWurx struggles with
   - Patterns in false positives/negatives

2. **Categorize improvement opportunities**
   - Error detection enhancements
   - Fix algorithm improvements
   - Human interaction optimization
   - Error reporting clarity

3. **Implement FixWurx enhancements**
   - Prioritize based on frequency and severity of issues
   - Develop test cases to validate improvements

4. **Re-test with original test suite**
   - Verify that previous failure cases now succeed
   - Confirm no regression in previously successful cases

## 7. Expected Outcomes

Through this testing process, we expect to:

1. Validate FixWurx's ability to detect and fix common programming errors
2. Identify strengths and weaknesses in the current implementation
3. Generate actionable data for continuous improvement
4. Establish baseline metrics for evaluating future versions

By systematically testing against known bugs with varying complexity and interdependence, we can comprehensively evaluate FixWurx's capabilities and establish a clear path for iterative improvement.

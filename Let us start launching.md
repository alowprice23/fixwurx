- Design this plan to be maximally independent from Plan A and Plan B
- Ensure the backup plan uses different approaches/technologies
- Create simplified implementation with focus on reliability over optimization
- Include thorough rollback and cleanup procedures

#### 12.1.3 Execution Strategy

##### Attempt Plan A
- Implement the first refined plan with complete instrumentation
- Monitor execution with enhanced logging
- Validate results against expected outcomes
- Proceed to verification phase if implementation succeeds
- If verification fails, document specific failure points

##### Attempt Plan B (on Plan A failure)
- Fully roll back any changes from Plan A
- Implement the second refined plan with complete instrumentation
- Apply learnings from Plan A failure to improve implementation
- Monitor execution with enhanced logging
- Validate results against expected outcomes
- If verification fails, document specific failure points

##### Attempt Backup Plan (on Plan B failure)
- Fully roll back any changes from Plan B
- Implement the backup plan with focus on minimal changes
- Apply conservative approach prioritizing stability
- Monitor execution with enhanced logging
- Validate results against expected outcomes
- If verification fails, document specific failure points

##### Halt and Report (on Backup Plan failure)
- Emit `🚫 HALT-BLOCKER <reason>` notification
- Generate comprehensive failure report including:
  * Detailed blocker description
  * Summary of all attempted approaches
  * Specific failure points for each attempt
  * System state at point of failure
  * Resource consumption statistics
  * Recommended next steps for human intervention
- Present user with concise summary of:
  * Tasks completed successfully
  * Tasks remaining
  * Specific items blocking progress
  * Suggested manual interventions

### 12.2 Learning from Blockers

#### 12.2.1 Blocker Pattern Recording
- Log detailed information about each blocker encountered
- Record all attempted solutions and their outcomes
- Store in neural matrix for future pattern matching
- Calculate frequency and impact metrics for each blocker type

#### 12.2.2 Preventative Strategy Development
- Analyze blocker patterns to identify early warning signs
- Develop detection heuristics for potential blocking conditions
- Create proactive avoidance strategies for common blockers
- Implement automatic detours around known problematic patterns

#### 12.2.3 System Improvement Feedback Loop
- Generate improvement recommendations based on blocker analysis
- Prioritize system enhancements to address frequent blockers
- Create test cases that reproduce blocking conditions
- Update neural matrix weights to better anticipate and avoid blockers
